About
---------
I'm a evolutionary biologist who loves data of all kinds. Finished my [Ph.D. on insect immunology](http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/12275/) in 2016; now seeking to transition into the field of data science by cutting my teeth in a variety of data analyst roles. I'm a massive football (soccer) nerd and like to test out new methods for analysis and visualisation using football data (see my blog posts).


Research Interests
---------
data mining + web scraping, predictive analytics, machine learning, automated image analysis, motion tracking, spatiotemporal data, time series analysis
