title: About me / CV
---

I'm a evolutionary biologist who loves data of all kinds. Finished my [Ph.D. on insect immunology](http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/12275/) in 2016 and now looking to transition into a career in data science. I'm a massive football (soccer) nerd and like to test out new methods for analysis and visualisation using football data (see my [blog posts](https://jogall.github.io/2017-05-12-home-away-pref/)).
