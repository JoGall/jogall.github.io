I’m not going to lie; I’m gutted about Coutinho leaving. Not as gutted as Suárez leaving, obviously, but still like 60% as gutted.

I’ve tried calling on righteous indignation from the ‘no player is bigger than the club’ mantra; I’ve tried saying good riddance and calling him a snake; I’ve tried suspending disbelief when listening to the tabloids tell me we’re going to replace him with Thomas Lemar, Julian Draxler, Alexis Sanchez, Leon Goretzka, or Riyad Mahrez (or possibly all five) this month. The only real positive seems to be that we were doomed to lose him anyway and letting him go now puts an end to the whole fiasco of endless media speculation and constant snide games from Barcelona, allowing the rest of the team to try and get back to the season at hand.

But it’s little comfort: there’s a huge void in our attack that needs filling immediately. If getting the right player in this month seems like a big ask, then getting a new signing to fit seamlessly into a new system and gel with a new set of teammates halfway through the season is nigh-on impossible. The potential for this to derail our season and cause us to miss out on Champions League qualification would totally negate any extra millions we squeezed from Barca by selling mid-season.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

I’m going to get a bit depressive and eulogise Phil’s Liverpool career for a couple of paragraphs here before I attempt to look for a golden sky, if only for my own catharsis. \*Dons black suit.\* An intelligent player that could carve something out of seemingly nothing, Coutinho really honed his finishing over the last few seasons, trademarking his cut-inside bangers from range and becoming clinical inside the box – in fact, I can’t off the top of my head remember him scoring a bad goal. But his development into a proper playmaker over the last two seasons has been an equal joy to behold; his ability to dictate the tempo of the game, his roaming movement and ability to open up areas of the pitch with a mazy dribble or well-placed pass.

His deep-lying central role in the 4-0 against West Ham near the end of last season really showcased this creativity and maturity for me, and was the first time I had that spine-tingling “holy shit, we’ve got a world class player on our hands” moment (closely followed by that spine-tingling “oh shit, Spain are soon going to be calling” moment). It’s these attributes that have proved the difference between a frustrating draw and grasping a hard-earned three points on many occasions. I won’t go as far as to say he recaptured Gerrard’s infamous ability to pick the team up by the scruff of the neck (Phil’s always seemed more likely to go missing in the big games), but it’s certainly the closest we’ve came to having it back since he left. I wish the lad the best of luck, although I’d be lying if I said it was with quite the same degree of genuine amicability as I wished the departing Suárez. [^1]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

To reiterate before I get too carried away with the doom and gloom: Phil’s loss feels nowhere near as devastating as Suárez’s. [^2] Probably not even as worrying as the departures of Xabi Alonso or Stevie G, because (a) we genuinely seem to have greater squad depth now than these previous times, and (b) we’ve got a manager I trust much more to find a suitable replacement than spunking the money on magic beans or Andy Carroll. [^3] The scheduled arrival of Naby Keita (probably) at the end of the season offers some comfort, although he seems like more of a replacement for Emre Can’s (or competition for Henderson’s) box-to-box-midfield role, i.e. more running, less cunning. (I still think we need a proper CDM too, but that’s a topic for another day.)

And there’s still plenty of positives to take from the immediate team. We’ve still got the rest of the ‘Fab Four’ (that’s one plus side at least, not having to cringe slightly at hearing this any more): Firmino’s dogged determinedness to win the ball back in dangerous areas and initiate an attack (I only found last week that he started his career in Brazil as a CDM, which explains a lot!), Mane’s pace and occasional ability to pass the ball, Salah’s... everything. Our wing backs – Robertson on the left and TAA / Gomez on the right – seem to be capable of whipping the ball in the box and are developing a promising overlap out wide. Oxlade-Chamberlain’s set piece delivery has also been fantastic in the last few games, which is potentially a match made in heaven with the arrival of VVD’s big head.

Nevertheless, one thing I feel we’ve often lacked without Coutinho playing is penetration on the front line, especially against teams that park the bus. Of all the touted replacements, the (realistically possible) one I’ve got my fingers crossed for is Thomas Lemar. I haven’t watched him play a great deal but from what I’m interested in what I have seen and read, he occupies the same position (out on the left wing or CAM), drops deep and drives forward into space, is comfortable retaining possession and a good passer, and decent from set pieces. The most common cons I’ve head are that he’s not as pacey, decidedly one-footed (so no more 25 yard cut-in bangers), and simply not going to replace the sheer creative power we’re losing; then again, I’d argue only a handful of players in the world could fill those boots in that respect. The fact that he’s 22 years old (and arguably better than Phil was at that age) and allegedly seeking a move away from Monaco should be his biggest selling points.

The inevitably bitter pill to swallow – whomever we go for, now or in the summer – is going to be the price; you’re never going to get a bargain with a transparent warchest. Reports suggested Monaco accepted a £90m from Arsenal in the summer (an apparently ill-conceived craic by Arsenal which they hilariously pulled the plug on immediately after the bid was accepted). Whilst this would have seemed like silly money even a year ago, if I was the man in charge right now and had the option to, I’d just say fuck it and shell up the £90m for him right now.

Well, enough speculation. I’ve got faith in Jurgen; he’s had five months to prepare for this increasingly-likely eventuality, and he’s got 23 shopping days left to steady the ship. But should February arrives and we’ve decided to wait until summer to splash the cash, that faith will dwindle in the face of being much less confident about us securing a top four finish this season.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

[^1]: It’s hard to put a finger on why I and many others feel this way. If a player genuinely wants to leave his current club and there’s nothing that can change his mind, then cashing in on a decent sum from the player’s departure is probably the only decent option available to the club. The £142m fee Coutinho fetched was in part down to him signing a new contract with Liverpool in January, although this contract was frequently used as a leash to tie him to the club for the next five years. One could argue this is exactly how contracts should work, yet I’ve heard many grievances about Emre Can refusing to sign a new contract and leaving for Juventus on a free at the end of this season, despite honouring his previous contract by seeing it out and refusing to sign another so he can leave once it ends. It seems that if you want to leave your club, you’re damned if you do and damned if you don’t (sign a new contract). All I know is that I’m aggrieved to be losing Can after us sinking £10m, four years, and 100+ games into developing him (I’m not bothered about losing him as a player as I’m one of those apparent freaks who doesn’t rate the lad; I appreciate his basic defensive abilities but think he offers very little going forward), and would rather get money for a departing player.

[^2]: Coutinho’s loss feels nowhere near as devastating as that of Luis Suárez.

[^3]: I’m not taking the piss specifically out of Kenny, I know he brought Suárez in during the same January window. We have had our share of woeful, ‘board-approved’ signings in the past though.
