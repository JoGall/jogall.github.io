When Burnley got beat 3-1 by Everton at Goodison Park on the 15th April, 33 games into their Premier League season, they'd gained only 4 points out of a possible 51 in their away fixtures. But during this time they'd also managed to accrue 32 points out of a possible 48 at Turf Moor; if the league table were based upon only home fixtures, they'd be in a highly impressive 6th place. But they were in 14th position in the real world, and would be rock bottom of the opposite hypothetical league which counted only away fixtures.

Newspapers seem to love rattling out stats like these but they're often just cherry-picking data. Why 33 games? What if Burnley won their next two home games and lost their next away game - these figures would be even more mind-blowing. What if they started winning away games and the pattern goes cold? Stats can often be manipulated to fit any narrative, and this is especially true in football reporting; here from 'Fortress Turf Moor' or 'Poor travellers Burnley destined for relegation'.

With just two games to go, Burnley are all but mathematically safe from relegation, but I wanted to look at the data to see whether they managed to cure their homesickness and how their skewed ratio of home:away points measures up to previous records. And whilst we're here, have any teams showed a wanderlust, preferring to pick up more of their points from away fixtures?

Let's fire up R. I've used the package `engsoccerdata` which includes databases of historical results from English (and European) football leagues and several built-in functions for analysing its data.

``` r
devtools::install_github("jalapic/engsoccerdata")
require(engsoccerdata)
require(dplyr)
require(ggplot2)
```

First, we need to update the `engsoccerdata` database with results from the current season using `england_current()` function and subset the dates as we're only interested in the PL era for this post (1992-93 - 2016-17).

``` r
#update 'england' dataframe if needed
england <- rbind(england, subset(england_current(), !(Date %in% england$Date & home %in% england$home)))

#subset
EPL <- rbind(england, england_current()) %>%
  subset(tier == 1 & Season %in% 1992:2016)
```

Have a quick look to make sure it's up to date.

``` r
tail(EPL, 5)
```

    ##              Date Season         home           visitor  FT hgoal vgoal

Next I've created a custom function, `maketable_ha()`, to make league tables for each PL season: one using only home fixtures for each team and another using only away fixtures.

``` r
maketable_ha <- function(df=NULL, Season=NULL, tier=NULL, pts=3, type = c("both", "home", "away")) {

  GA<-GF<-ga<-gf<-gd<-GD<-D<-L<-W<-Pts<-.<-Date<-home<-team<-visitor<-hgoal<-opp<-vgoal<-goaldif <-FT<-division<-result<-maxgoal<-mingoal<-absgoaldif<-NULL

  #subset by season and tier, if applicable
  if(!is.null(Season) & is.null(tier)) {
    dfx <- df[(df$Season == Season), ]
  } else if(is.null(Season) & !is.null(tier)) {
    dfx <- df[(df$tier == tier), ]
  } else if(!is.null(Season) & !is.null(tier)) {
    dfx <- df[(df$Season == Season & df$tier == tier), ]
  } else {
    dfx <- df
  }

  #subset only home or away fixtures, if applicable
  if(match.arg(type)=="home") {
    temp <- select(dfx, team=home, opp=visitor, GF=hgoal, GA=vgoal)
  } else if(match.arg(type)=="away") {
    temp <- select(dfx, team=visitor, opp=home, GF=vgoal, GA=hgoal)
  } else if(match.arg(type)=="both") {
    temp <-rbind(
        select(dfx, team=home, opp=visitor, GF=hgoal, GA=vgoal),
        select(dfx, team=visitor, opp=home, GF=vgoal, GA=hgoal)
    )
  }
    
  #make table
  table <- temp %>%
    mutate(GD = GF-GA) %>%
    group_by(team) %>%
    summarise(GP = sum(GD<=100),
              W = sum(GD>0),
              D = sum(GD==0),
              L = sum(GD<0),
              gf = sum(GF),
              ga = sum(GA),
              gd = sum(GD)
    ) %>%
    mutate(Pts = (W*pts) + D) %>%
    arrange(-Pts, -gd, -gf) %>%
    mutate(Pos = rownames(.)) %>%
    as.data.frame()
    
    table <- arrange(table, -Pts, -gd, -gf)

  return(table)
  
}
```

Home points ratio (HPR)
-----------------------

We'll apply the `maketable_ha()` function to calculate a 'home points ratio', `HPR`: the proportion of total points that were gained at home by each team in each season (1.0 = all of a team's points for the season were gained at home; 0.0 = no points gained at home).

``` r
dd <- lapply(unique(EPL$Season), function(x) {
  
  #league tables for home fixtures
  home <- maketable_ha(EPL, Season = x, tier = 1, type="home") %>%
    mutate(Hpts = Pts, GPH = GP)
  #league tables for away fixtures
  away <- maketable_ha(EPL, Season = x, tier = 1, type="away") %>%
    mutate(Apts = Pts, GPA = GP)
  #combined (real) league table
  both <- maketable_ha(EPL, Season = x, tier = 1, type="both") %>%
    mutate(real_pos = Pos)
  
  #merge together
  plyr::join_all(list(home, away, both), by = "team", type = 'full') %>%
    mutate(Season = x, GP = GPH + GPA, Pos = real_pos) %>%
    select(Season, team, GP, GPH, Hpts, GPA, Apts, Pos) %>%
    mutate(HPR = Hpts / (Hpts + Apts) ) %>%
    arrange(HPR)
} ) %>%
#collapse this list to a dataframe
plyr::rbind.fill() %>%
#order by ascending home points ratio
arrange(HPR)

#prettify the season variable (e.g. 2016 -> 2016/17)
dd$season <- as.factor(paste0(dd$Season, "-", substr(dd$Season+1, 3, 4)))
```

Let's have a quick look at either end of this dataframe.

``` r
dd %>% select(season, team, GP, Hpts, Apts, HPR) %>% head
```

    ##    season             team GP Hpts Apts       HPR
    ## 1 1997-98   Crystal Palace 38   11   22 0.3333333
    ## 2 1993-94     Norwich City 42   21   32 0.3962264
    ## 3 2008-09        Hull City 38   14   21 0.4000000
    ## 4 2003-04 Blackburn Rovers 38   19   25 0.4318182
    ## 5 2014-15   Crystal Palace 38   21   27 0.4375000
    ## 6 2000-01  Manchester City 38   15   19 0.4411765

``` r
dd %>% select(season, team, GP, Hpts, Apts, HPR) %>% tail
```

    ##      season          team GP Hpts Apts       HPR
    ## 501 2016-17     Hull City 36   28    6 0.8235294
    ## 502 2016-17       Burnley 36   33    7 0.8250000
    ## 503 1999-00 Coventry City 38   37    7 0.8409091
    ## 504 2005-06        Fulham 38   41    7 0.8541667
    ## 505 1992-93  Leeds United 42   44    7 0.8627451
    ## 506 2009-10       Burnley 38   26    4 0.8666667

Interestingly, Burnley have the largest home points ratio, but not from this season; they gained only 4 out of 30 points (87%) away from home in the 09/10 season away. Nevertheless, this season's Burnley also clock in at 5th place with 83% of points gained at home. Crystal Palace have the lowest HPR by quite some margin, gaining only 33% total points from home fixtures during the 97/98 season. As expected, our PL average shows a slight preference for home fixtures overall, with teams picking up 61% of their total points at home on average.

We can visualise this data by plotting the 10 largest vs. the 10 smallest HPRs and comparing them against a PL average (shown in grey). (I've presented HPR as a percentage as it seems more intuitive, and normalised the bars relative to 50% as this is our null hypothesis, i.e. no home or away preference.)

Out of curiosity, here's the same plot but for the top flight across **all** seasons (1888 - present; using 3 points for a win for all seasons).

This season's Burnley only have the 64th highest home points ratio now; 1st place goes to Wolves, who managed to gain only 1 out of their 31 points away from home in the 1895-96 season (given 3 points for a win as in the modern era). Leeds are the only other team in top flight history to equal the feat of gaining one single away point - out of 24 total points in the 1946-47 season. Blackpool hold the all time highest away points bias, picking up 19 out of 27 points away from home in the 1966-67 season.

Interesting to see that any individual season variation in HPR is eliminated and now all teams show at least some preference for home fixtures. Nevertheless, Crystal Palace again show the lowest level of home bias (51% of points at home) and Burnley the most (76%), although Burnley have far fewer games under their belt and this could be expected to revert to a lower mean.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Points per game (ppg): home and away
------------------------------------

One other thing we might be interested in: the absolute number of points gained at home and away, instead of their relative ratios - total points is the only statistic that matters in the end after all. To this we'll calculate points per game (ppg) for both home (`ppg_home`) and away (`ppg_away`) fixtures.

First let's look at each individual each season:

``` r
dd4 <- dd %>% 
  mutate(ppg_home = Hpts/GPH, ppg_away = Apts/GPA) %>%
  select(season, team, GP, Pos, HPR, ppg_home, ppg_away) %>%
  arrange(desc(ppg_away))

#group by league finish: top 4, relegated, or 5th - 17th 
dd4$Pos <- as.numeric(dd4$Pos)
dd4$col <- ifelse(dd4$Pos >= 18, "rel", ifelse(dd4$Pos <=4, "top", "mid"))
dd4$col <- factor(dd4$col, levels = c("top", "mid", "rel")) #reorder for plotting

rbind(head(dd4), tail(dd4))
```

    ##      season              team GP Pos       HPR  ppg_home  ppg_away col

So teams who finish the season with a higher HPR seem to finish lower down the table; more of a case of faring poorly away than being excellent at home. Meanwhile, those near the top tend to have a more equal home / away points ratio.

Here's the same figures with three colour groups get a better feel for finishing position:

So to win the league you've got to pick up high points per game home **and** away, right? Let's look at the records for every PL winner:

``` r
dd4[dd4$Pos==1,] %>% arrange(HPR)
```

Well, Manchester United won the league in 2010-11 with only 1.32 ppg away from home. And on the flip side, Arsenal became champions in 2001-02 with a higher ppg from away fixtures (2.47) than home (2.10). For comparison, the median overall ppg (home and away fixtures) for PL winners is 2.29 (87 points), although United managed to win it in 1996-97 with an unbelievable 75 points (1.97 ppg)... (To put that into soul-destroying persepective as a Liverpool fan, Liverpool got 84 points when they finished runners-up in 2013-14.)

HPR vs. ppg\_home and ppg\_away
-------------------------------

Finally, let's pool the data for `ppg_home` and `ppg_away` as we did before to see each team's overall record in the PL.

``` r
dd5 <- dd %>% 
  group_by(team) %>%
  summarise(ppg_home = sum(Hpts) / sum(GPH), ppg_away = sum(Apts) / sum(GPA)) %>%
  mutate(HPR = ppg_home / (ppg_home + ppg_away)) %>%
  arrange(desc(ppg_away))

rbind(head(dd5), tail(dd5))
```

    ## # A tibble: 12 × 4
    ##                 team  ppg_home  ppg_away       HPR
    ## *              <chr>     <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>
    ## 1  Manchester United 2.3479167 1.8580376 0.5582364
    ## 2            Arsenal 2.1544885 1.6270833 0.5697336
    ## 3            Chelsea 2.1231733 1.5895833 0.5718590
    ## 4          Liverpool 2.0625000 1.4187500 0.5924596
    ## 5    Manchester City 1.8020833 1.2207792 0.5961513
    ## 6       Leeds United 1.7692308 1.1880342 0.5982659
    ## 7          Hull City 1.1808511 0.6382979 0.6491228
    ## 8           Barnsley 1.3157895 0.5263158 0.7142857
    ## 9       Cardiff City 1.0526316 0.5263158 0.6666667
    ## 10      Swindon Town 0.9047619 0.5238095 0.6333333
    ## 11     Bradford City 1.1842105 0.4473684 0.7258065
    ## 12           Burnley 1.3928571 0.4464286 0.7572816

If we plot home ppg against away ppg and fill according to home points ratio we can see that teams with the highest HPR tend to have the lowest number of points per game. This seems to support the idea that a high HPR is caused more by having away jitters than a home fortress.

In conclusion...
----------------

I'm not sure how useful this information is (if at all), but I find exploring data that interests me is always a good way to get to grips with new methods or technologies; this was my first time piping with `magrittr` and my first time using `knitr` and rmarkdown.

Popular sports like football tend to generate a massive amount data but their interpretation by the mainstream media often leaves a lot to be desired. Hopefully this post shows how useful open-source databases and tools like `engsoccerdata` can make it easy to conduct a more rigorous analysis!
